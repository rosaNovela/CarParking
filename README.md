Parking Management System 

The Parking Management System is a smart, user-friendly application designed to address the ongoing parking challenges experienced by students and faculty at Rosebank College. The current parking system lacks real-time visibility and efficiency, often resulting in individuals wasting valuable time searching for available parking spaces, arriving late to classes, and experiencing unnecessary frustration.

This application provides a real-time parking management solution that allows users to view available parking spaces before entering the campus. By offering live updates on parking availability, the system eliminates uncertainty and reduces congestion caused by vehicles searching for non-existent parking spots.

The system enables authorized students and faculty members to book parking spaces in advance, ensuring fair allocation and preventing unauthorized use of parking facilities. Access control features ensure that only approved users can utilize the parking areas, improving overall campus security and organization.

Designed with scalability in mind, the Parking Management System can easily accommodate future expansions, such as an increase in parking spaces or users. By improving efficiency, reducing delays, and enhancing productivity, the application creates a smoother and more reliable parking experience for everyone on campus.
